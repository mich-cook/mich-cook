- 👋 Hi, I’m @mich-cook
- 👀 I’m interested in building fun stuff in JavaScript.
- 🌱 I’m currently modernizing my skillset with popular technologies (react, graphql, aws, firebase, gcp, docker, etc). I've been around long enough that they're not difficult - just different.
- 💞️ I’m looking to find the next step in my career that builds new things and hopefully contributes to the open source ecosystem we use.
